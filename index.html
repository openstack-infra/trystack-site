            <h2>Testing only, please.</h2>
            <p><strong>Rule No. 1: Remember that TryStack is designed
                exclusively as a testing sandbox.</strong> We wanted a
              fast, easy way for developers to test code against a real
              OpenStack environment, without having to stand up hardware
              themselves. It probably goes without saying that this is
              not the place for production code - you should host only
              test code and test servers here. In fact, your account on
              TryStack will be periodically wiped to help make sure no
              one account tries to rule tyrannically over our democracy.
              Play nice in the sandbox!</p>

            <h2>What can I do with TryStack?</h2>
            <p>TryStack resembles the type of cloud environment you can 
              create on your own with OpenStack Software. However, we 
              have set a few sensible limits in place for the good of 
              the project. First, the server instances you launch are 
              only available for 24 hours until the hardware is reclaimed 
              for use by new instances.
              You can select from several available varieties of images
              (CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, and OpenSUSE) or upload your own
	          and we'll be adding more.&nbsp;
	        <br>
            </p>
            <h2>How should I use TryStack?</h2>
            <p><strong>For testing purposes only—TryStack is a testing
                environment by design.</strong> Instances are typically
              deleted after 24 hours, so for obvious reasons you should
              <strong>NOT</strong> put any data on this cloud you don't
              want to lose.</p>
            <h2>Wait... the server instances I create won't last
              forever?</h2>
            <p>You got it. Scripts run periodically to remove instances
              after 24-hours. Your instances may also be removed if your
              account uses more than your allocated project quota of one
              instance.&nbsp; Your accounts will never be deleted during
              the current OpenStack release. </p>
            <h2>Is there an SLA?</h2>
            <p>Since this cloud is managed by volunteers in the
              OpenStack community, there is no SLA. The cloud may go
              down from time to time for maintenance or to upgrade to
              the latest release of OpenStack.</p>
