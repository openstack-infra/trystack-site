      <h2>Testing only, please.</h2>
      <p><strong>Rule No. 1: Remember that TryStack is designed exclusively as a testing sandbox.</strong> We wanted a fast, easy way for developers to test code against a real OpenStack environment, without having to stand up hardware themselves. It probably goes without saying that this is not the place for production code - you should host only test code and test servers here. In fact, your account on TryStack will be periodically wiped to help make sure no one account tries to rule tyrannically over our democracy. Play nice in the sandbox!</p>

      <p>There are a few great avenues available to get help. For quick API reference, the OpenStack Compute and OpenStack Identity APIs are well documented at <a href="http://api.openstack.org/">api.openstack.org</a>. It would also serve you well to spend a moment reading the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/api/quick-start/content/">API Quick Start Guide</a>. More OpenStack documentation is also available at <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/">docs.openstack.org</a>. Finally, OpenStack has a very active IRC channel #openstack. You can quickly connect right in your browser using <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">The FreeNode Browser Client</a>.</p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>

    <div class="span10">
      <h2>What can I do with TryStack?</h2>
      <p>TryStack, in large part, resembles the type of cloud environment you can create on your own with OpenStack Software. However, we have set a few sensible limits in place for the good of the project. First, the server instances you launch are only available for 24 hours until the hardware is reclaimed for use by new instances. Secondly, you can't upload your own server images, you can only select from three available images (Ubuntu 12.10, Fedora17 and Fedora18). Lastly, even though you can view the API endpoints on the Dashboard, we are limiting API access in the x86 zone.</p>
      <h2>How should I use TryStack?</h2>
      <p><strong>For testing purposes only&mdash;TryStack is a testing environment by design.</strong> Instances are typically deleted after 24 hours, so for obvious reasons you should <strong>NOT</strong> put any data on this cloud you don't want to lose.</p>
      <h2>Wait... the server instances I create won't last forever?</h2>
      <p>You got it. Scripts run periodically to remove instances after 24-hours. Your instances may also be removed if your account uses more than your allocated project quota of one instance. </p>
      <h2>Is there an SLA?</h2>
      <p>Since this cloud is managed by volunteers in the OpenStack community, there is no SLA. The cloud may go down from time to time for maintenance or to upgrade to the latest release of OpenStack.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="span10">
      <h2>Why can't I have more project quota?</h2>
      <p>When you first get your account, it will be preloaded with a set amount of project quota which is 1 instance and 512 MB RAM total.</p>
      <p>Don't get too hung up on your quota, we have to keep limits in place to prevent abuse. </p>
